#### UPDATE NOTICE
Please update to Ajax Load More 3.5.1 (or greater) prior to updating Custom Repeaters v2.

This 2.5 update contains a major change to how the repeater templates are saved and displayed.
On update, your Repeater Templates will be moved from `plugins/ajax-load-more-repeaters-v2/repeaters` to the `alm_templates` directory within `wp-content/uploads`.
This is a long overdue enhancement and I highly recommend you backup your site (or Repeater Templates) prior to updating in case permission issues occur during the upgrade process.

* UPDATE - Updated the directory ALM stores Repeater Template files. Templates are now saved to the WP Uploads directory (`uploads/alm_templates/`).
* UPDATE - Removed vendor files as they are now included in core ALM.
